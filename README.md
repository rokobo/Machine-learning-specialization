# Machine learning specialization

Collection of Jupyter notebooks with machine learning algorithms I learned in the Stanford's Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng course. The notebooks contain problems and my solutions. The following algorithms were implemented:

1. Linear regression using gradient descent (1 problem).
